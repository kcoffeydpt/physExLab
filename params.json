Join Github (free) https://github.com/\r\n2. Send me their Github username so I can add them as a collaborator to the repository\r\n3. Fork the repo so it is set up in your Github account\r\n4. Either set up Git on your computer (https://git-scm.com/), or just use Github \r\n\r\nFor #3 and #4 you may want to watch the Github tutorials (https://github.com/)\r\n\r\nThere is also a great resource for starting out (free) on the Data Scientist Toolbox Github page: https://datasciencespecialization.github.io/toolbox/\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\nStudents can use any of these files for their second lab report - or can continue to use the data we collect in lab though I anticipate those reports will take a focus on one or a few subjects as opposed to on many subjects. If you are interested in a project on many subjects the data sets attached are your best approach. \r\n\r\nIf you know of freely available (open) data sets that you are interested in using - just let me know and I can check them out, possibly even archive them here for future use.\r\n\r\n### Workflow \r\n\r\nIf you want to use one of these sets of data then I think it is only natural for me to help you with the analysis. We should communicate about what you would like to do and the best way to analyze the data to answer the questions you find interesting. It is common for researchers to collaborate with a data analyst for their project. So, in this situation, consider me your data analyst consultant. Depending on the question you are interested in answering, I may end up doing the analysis for you and helping you with the interpretation. But you remain ultimately responsible for writing the report.\r\n\r\n#### Issues\r\n1. Resolved - the attached files are now fixed (The power values for the wingate are far to high, need to figure out this problem)\r\n\r\n### Class data files\r\nAll files can be linked through the subject ID number\r\n\r\n#### Data files (csv)\r\n1. BasicData.csv: contains height, weight, age\r\n2. BodyComp.csv: contained estimated body composition based on skin fold procedure\r\n3. MuscularFitness.csv: data on muscular fitness (strength and endurance) with grip, pushup, wall sits\r\n4. Power.csv: data on estimated power with vertical jump and a push up test \r\n5. PreTest.csv: data on subject history of injury, very general information about health (PAR-Q) and exercise habits\r\n6. Wingate.csv: data on Wingate test (small sample)\r\n7. combinedData.csv: contains one row per subject with the above data other than the wingate test\r\n8. allData.csv: includes the wingate so has 6 rows per subject for the subjects that completed the wingate\r\n\r\n#### Analysis files (in R)\r\n1. combineData.R is an R script that reads in the data from different labs, cleans it up a bit, and then combines all the data files from separate labs, joins them by \"ID\". Creates a \"combinedData.csv\" file that contains one row per subject and does not include the wingate test; whereas the \"allData.csv\" file includes the wingate so has 6 rows per subject for the subjects that completed the wingate \r\n\r\n### Astrand_1964 data \r\n\r\nData on aerobic capacity measures from classic (and existing) published paperand publically available data by Astrand et al in 1954\r\n\r\nThis includes data on the cardiovascular components of the Fick equation for VO2; as well as indirect calorimetry measures of VO2 during an incremental exercise test to max in a sample of 23 healthy college age subjects\r\n\r\n### NHL Combine Data\r\n\r\nData from the NHL combine that is available online at\r\n\r\nhttp://centralscouting.nhl.com/link3/cs/combine.nsf/Attachments/CombineResultsSpreadsheet/$FILE/combine-results.xls\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
