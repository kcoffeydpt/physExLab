### Draft in progress
 
Data analysis performed for Albert's physiology of exercise lab report

Based on the Astrand et al, 1964 data set

From Albert:
"This report will present data on whether or not heart rate will affect someone's vo2max. Vo2 max is the maximum amount of oxygen the body can use during a specified period of usually intense exercise that depends on body weight and the strength of the lungs. Resting heart rate is the number of contractions of the heart that occur in a single minute while the body is at complete rest.

The hypothesis in this study is that someone with a higher vo2max will have a lower resting heart rate, and that submaximal heart rate and max heart rate relate to max vo2. As someone exercises there is a greater demand for oxygen in the muscles which then causes the heart rate to go up due to the oxygen being delivered around the body. This paper will describe why or why not these labs correspond and have affect on each other.

With the data provided from the astrand database, heart rate will be compared to the different stages of the vo2max and see if there is a correlation. Also resting heart rate will be compared to max vo2 and submaximal heart rate and max heart rate. Max heart rate will be calculate for all subjects as well. To do this, there will be many graphs, scatter plots and data charts."
