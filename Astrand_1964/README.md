# Astrand et al, 1964 data

Data on 23 subjects, males and female, between the ages of 20 and 30

Variables included:
subject number
age
height
weight
plasma volume
heart volume
stage (of exercise test)
VO2
Q
HR
SV
AV_diff - is the (a-v)O2 difference
CaO2
Hb
Hla
VO2_mlkg
METs
SV_L
SV_mlkg
Q_mlkg

Could look at the relationship between VO2 and all elements of the Fick equation

Can compare how Max Q is associated with Max VO2 in their absolute and relative forms; for this you will want to read the paper and see how they actually tested subjects (i.e. bike vs. treadmill will make a difference)

If you have a question you want investigate with this data set start with the paper; then let me know what the question is and we can start to consider how we might analyze the data to answer your question.

Is there a difference between VO2 and Q between men and women; does this difference persist when considered relative to body mass?

Does max VO2 (relative) predict the HR and SV response to exercise?
